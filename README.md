Peer-graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

This project take data from:

Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset
Version 1.0

https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

==================================================================
==================================================================


The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'

- 'run_analysis.R': script file that implements the asked tasks.

- 'tidy.csv': file saved from dataset generated by the script.
- 'tidy.txt': file saved from dataset generated by the script.

- 'codebook.md': with the data to indicate all the variables and summaries calculated, along with units, and any other relevant information.

Assignment: 
======
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following.

- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
